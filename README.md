# POC: EDGE COMPUTING FOR BIOMETRIC ACCESS CONTROL BASED ON 3D ANTISPOOFING AND DEEP LEARNING RECOGNITION
### Master Thesis
#### Author: orla.dev (Francesco Orlandi)

This is part of an academic project developed for the master thesis in Computer and Automation Engineering at the University of Siena all rights are reserved to the creator.

This is a POC which is fairly basic, but nontheless illustrate the points of face detection and 2D antispoofing mechanisms using librealsense SDK, dlib library and OpenCV.

Keep in mind that in order to run the project you need the following libraries installed:

- librealsense SDK
- dlib
- OpenCV
